## Day29 - Countdown Timer

**What did I learn?** - timestamps, set & clear intervals and Date.now(). The Date.now() method returns the number of milliseconds elapsed since 1 January 1970 00:00:00 UTC. Because now() is a static method of Date, we can always use it as Date.now() instead of new Date().now().
